Step-by-Step Guide for Your Express + MongoDB Project

This guide will help you structure your project efficiently and know which files to create first. 🚀

⸻

1️⃣ Set Up the Basic Server
	•	Install Node.js and MongoDB.
	•	Initialize a new project with npm init -y.
	•	Install dependencies: Express, Mongoose, dotenv, and any necessary middleware.
	•	Create a server.js file to handle the basic Express setup.

⸻

2️⃣ Set Up the Project Folder Structure

Inside your project folder, create this structure:

backend/
│── models/            # 📌 Schemas (Mongoose models)
│── controllers/       # 📌 Handles business logic
│── routes/            # 📌 API endpoints
│── middleware/        # 📌 Authentication, validation, etc.
│── utils/             # 📌 Helper functions
│── config/            # 📌 Database connection settings
│── public/            # 📌 Static files (if needed)
│── uploads/           # 📌 File uploads (if applicable)
│── server.js          # 📌 Main entry point
│── .env               # 📌 Environment variables
│── package.json       # 📌 Project metadata



⸻

3️⃣ Create the Database Connection
	•	Inside config/, create a database config file to connect MongoDB.
	•	Load environment variables using .env.

⸻

4️⃣ Define Your Database Models (Schemas)
	•	Inside models/, create Mongoose schemas for Researcher and Learner.
	•	Each model should have its own file.

⸻

5️⃣ Set Up Controllers (Business Logic)
	•	Inside controllers/, create separate controllers for:
	•	Researcher (handles login, data management)
	•	Learner (handles user progress, studies, etc.)

⸻

6️⃣ Define Routes
	•	Inside routes/, create separate files for:
	•	researcherRoutes.js
	•	learnerRoutes.js
	•	These routes will call functions from the controllers.

⸻

7️⃣ Add Middleware (If Needed)
	•	Create middleware for:
	•	Authentication (JWT, session-based)
	•	Validation (Ensure correct data input)

⸻

8️⃣ Set Up File Uploads (If Needed)
	•	If researchers need to upload files (e.g., study materials), configure Multer inside uploads/.

⸻

9️⃣ Test the API with Postman or Thunder Client
	•	Start the server and test routes.
	•	Check MongoDB to see if data is saved correctly.

⸻

🔟 Connect Frontend (If Applicable)
	•	If you have a frontend (React, Vue, etc.), connect it to your API.

⸻

Bonus: Improve with Authentication & Security
	•	Implement JWT authentication for researchers.
	•	Add rate limiting and security best practices.

⸻
